# CONCLUSION 
 
- A poisson regression model was developed for Adverse Event Type 2.

    -  The selected best exposure metric was C(ave2) (ng/mL) (p<0.0001).
    -  For the model of Adverse Event Type 2, the analysis dataset included 1000 study participants. 504 of them reported events and 482 of them reported non-events. 
    -  There was one covariate in the final model: Geographical Location.
    -  The covariate Geographical Location, with the reference level of Geographical Location US, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the model fit. The odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for Geographical Location Non-US are 1.96 (1.64, 2.34), respectively.

- A poisson regression model was developed for Adverse Event Type 3.

    -  There was not a statistically significant exposure response relationship.
    -  For the model of Adverse Event Type 3, the analysis dataset included 1000 study participants. 312 of them reported events and 681 of them reported non-events. 
    -  There was one covariate in the final model: Sex.
    -  The covariate Sex, with the reference level of Sex Male, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the model fit. The odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for Sex Female are 1.66 (1.32, 2.09), respectively.
